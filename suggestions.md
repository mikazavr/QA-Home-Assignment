# Suggestions

After digging into the Conduit RealWorld application and giving it a thorough look, I found several areas to improve. This section outlines areas for improvement identified during a review of the Conduit RealWorld application:
---

**Issue:** The application lacks loaders, error messages (which are inconsistent across different forms), and state indicators for various components. 
**Suggestion:** To enhance the overall user experience, implement consistent loaders and error messages throughout the application. Each form and component should include clear state indicators such as loaders, disabled buttons, and success/failure messages.

**Issue:** The app is responsive but does not offer a user-friendly layout for mobile devices.
**Suggestion:** Redesign the mobile layout to enhance usability.

**Issue:** Both the client-side and backend have poor and limited validations. Weak validation controls allow users to submit invalid data (e.g., excessively long strings, potentially malicious content) resulting in server errors and security vulnerabilities.
**Suggestion:** Implement comprehensive validation on both the client and server sides to ensure input integrity and security. Ensure fields have appropriate length limits, character restrictions, and required formats.

**Issue:** API responses may not provide sufficient information or consistency in error handling, making it difficult for users to understand what went wrong.
**Suggestion:** Enhance API error responses to include meaningful error messages and codes. Ensure consistency in the structure of error responses across the API.

**Issue:** Tokens do not expire and can be copied across browsers, posing a significant security risk.
**Suggestion:** Implement token expiration and refresh mechanisms to enhance security. Ensure that tokens are tied to specific sessions and cannot be reused across different devices. Use libraries like JWT with expiration settings and implement refresh tokens. Use secure cookie storage and consider implementing same-site and HTTP-only flags to protect tokens.

**Issue:** The current functionality of the app is very basic, limiting user engagement and interactivity.
**Suggestion:** Extend the current functionality to include more interactive features. Add the ability for users to search for other users and articles, create lists of saved articles, and other enhancements that enrich the user experience.
